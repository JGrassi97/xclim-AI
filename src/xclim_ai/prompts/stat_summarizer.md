## You are analyzing a climate-related dataset with the aim of detecting signals of climate change and understanding its potential future impacts.

Here is a brief description of the dataset:  
`{result.attrs}`  

Here are computed statistics:  
- **Statistics**: `{stats_dict}`   

Your task is to write a **structured and insightful markdown summary** that highlights the most relevant findings for climate change analysis, with a particular emphasis on **long-term change** and **future climate risk**.

Please organize your response into the following sections:

---

### 1. **Indicator Description and Computation Method**  
Briefly explain what this indicator measures and how it is computed, using the dataset metadata. Emphasize how it relates to climate-relevant processes or risks (e.g., heatwaves, droughts, variability).

---

### 2. **Yearly Data Overview**  
**2.1.** Detect and describe any significant **long-term trends**, especially those consistent with expected climate change patterns (e.g., warming, drying, increased variability).  
**2.2.** Comment on **changes over specific time periods** (e.g., pre-2000 vs post-2000, last 10 years) to highlight accelerating or shifting trends.  
**2.3.** Identify the **years with minimum and maximum values**, especially if they are recent or cluster in certain decades. Discuss how these may represent **emerging extremes**.  
**2.4.** Report the **mean** and **standard deviation**, and discuss what they suggest about variability or transition toward new climate regimes.

---

### 3. **Monthly Data Overview**  
**3.1.** Analyze **seasonal patterns and cycles**, and assess whether they have changed over time (e.g., earlier onsets, shifts in peaks).  
**3.2.** Highlight **months and years with particularly high or low values**, and evaluate whether these reflect exceptional events or structural change.  
**3.3.** Report the **mean** and **standard deviation** across months, and discuss **variability**, **anomalies**, or **emergent seasonal extremes** (e.g., hotter summers, milder winters).

---

### 4. **Climate Change Signals and Future Outlook**  
**4.1.** Based on observed data, comment on **early-warning signals** of climate shifts that may intensify in the coming decades (e.g., persistent warming, reduced variability, or more frequent extremes).  
**4.2.** If possible, connect recent trends to **projected future risks** in similar indicators from climate models (e.g., continued increase in hot days, declining rainfall, growing interannual variability).  
**4.3.** Comment on the **time horizon** over which these trends appear to emerge (e.g., since 1980s, post-2000, accelerating after 2010), and how that aligns with climate model expectations.

#### **Important guidelines**
- Do **not** present exhaustive tables or raw statistics.  
- Instead, write a **narrative interpretation**, supported by **plenty of specific numerical values**.  
- Focus on **detecting and explaining signals of climate change**, especially changes in **trend, variability, and extremes**.  
- Be explicit in identifying potential **future climate risks** suggested by the historical data.
